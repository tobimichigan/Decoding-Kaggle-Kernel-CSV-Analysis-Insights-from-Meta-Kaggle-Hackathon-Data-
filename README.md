<p>In this writeup, using code files (.r, .py, & ipnyb or notebook files) in /kaggle/input/meta-kaggle-code as well as  meta data csv files located in /kaggle/input/meta-kaggle,  I leverage a multi‑stage analytical pipeline—comprising Kaggle Kernel & CSV Analysis, a Full Pipeline for CSV & Code Repository Analytics, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)—to uncover the evolving landscape of Kaggle hackathon participation and performance.

Kaggle Kernel & CSV Analysis begins by sampling at least eighty (80) Python, R, and notebook files (up to 20 per extension) from the code repository, extracting metadata such as library usage, code cell counts, and total lines of code. A bar chart of the top‑10 most imported libraries reveals the dominance of TensorFlow, scikit‑learn, and pandas in hackathon workflows. Histogram analyses of code lengths quantify variability in script complexity, while distribution plots of script execution count highlight differences in iterative development across authors.

The Meta Kaggle Hackathon Full Pipeline integrates CSV data (Competitions, Submissions, Kernels) with the extracted code metadata to generate time‑series aggregations by implementing a config method to capture a subset of files to parse due to limited computational resources and huge size of the meta data code. Line plots of monthly counts illustrate a steady rise in enabled competitions and kernel creations, with a notable surge in participation during Q4 2024. Rolling‑average trend lines smooth seasonal fluctuations and emphasize long‑term growth. Parallel analyses of public vs. private submission scores uncover convergence of evaluation metrics over time, indicating an increasingly competitive environment.

In the Exploratory Data Analysis phase, EDA plots delve deeper into performance benchmarking and collaboration patterns. Histograms of script duration pinpoint a right‑skewed distribution: most kernels execute under 30 seconds, yet outliers exceed several minutes. Bar charts of top‑20 users by kernel count identify key contributors driving the community forward. Correlation heatmaps among engineered features (e.g., submission counts, score differentials, engagement metrics) reveal clusters of related behaviors, guiding feature selection for downstream predictive modeling.

Collectively, these graphical insights paint a comprehensive picture of how Kaggle hackathon participants utilize code resources, engage with competitions, and evolve their workflows over time. The study demonstrates the value of combining code‑level metadata with competition outcomes to better understand the nature of progress in the ML and AI fields on Kaggle.
